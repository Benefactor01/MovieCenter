# MovieCenter
This is a home project for Programming Environment and Programming Technologies class.

My program is colled MovieCenter, and it is made to list all kinds of films.

When you login the application, a fancy image slider welcomes you.

You can find many information about movies, such as Title, Director, etc.

There is a login and register page for it, and it stores all data in an online database, called remotemysql.com.

The controls are simple, just click on the buttons.
